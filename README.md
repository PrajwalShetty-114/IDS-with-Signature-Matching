# 🚨 Intrusion Detection System with Signature Matching 🛡️

<p align="center">
  A fully responsive 📱, animated ✨, and interactive 🖱️ website that simulates a Signature-Based Intrusion Detection System (IDS). This project was built to provide a clear and practical understanding of this fundamental cybersecurity mechanism.

## ✨ Key Features

This project isn't just functional; it's designed to be "cool" and "awesome" with a modern, aesthetic feel.

* 🎨 **Stunning & Modern UI:** A custom design system built from scratch. It features a "frosted glass" navigation bar, a professional "Inter" font, and a vibrant indigo color palette.
* 🪄 **Lottie Animations:** Beautiful, lightweight JSON animations are used on every single page to create a lively and dynamic user experience.
* 📱 **Fully Responsive:** The entire website is mobile-first and includes a "hamburger" menu and responsive grid layouts that look great on desktops, tablets, and phones.
* 🤖 **Interactive Simulation:** A real, working simulation dashboard where users can input "network traffic" and see the system detect threats in real-time.
* 🗂️ **"Awesome" Card Layouts:** Unique, custom-designed, and animated cards for the **Objectives**, **Theory**, and **Procedure** pages to make the content engaging.
* 🚀 **Smooth Page Loads:** All content cards animate in with a "fade-and-slide-up" effect for a smooth, polished feel.

## 🗺️ Website Pages

The project is divided into 6 clear, animated pages:

1.  **🏠 Home:** A stunning two-column "hero" page with a Lottie animation to welcome the user.
2.  **🎯 Aim:** A clean, two-column layout with an animation to clearly state the project's goal.
3.  **🧠 Theory:** An animated "feature card" layout that uses Lottie animations to explain the three core concepts (IDS, Signature, Matching).
4.  **🏆 Objectives:** A "card grid" layout that makes the project objectives look professional and engaging.
5.  **🔢 Procedure:** A "step-card" guide with "01, 02, 03..." counters to guide the user.
6.  **🔬 Simulation:** The two-column interactive "dashboard" where the signature matching algorithm runs.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

This project requires a live server to bypass browser security (CORS) for loading the Lottie animations.

1.  **Download or Clone:**
    * Download the project ZIP file and unzip it.
    * OR: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git`

2.  **Get the Animation Files:**
    * This is a crucial step! The project needs the following JSON files in the main folder:
    * `animation.json` (for the Home page)
    * `animation-aim.json` (for the Aim page)
    * `animation-ids.json` (for the Theory page)
    * `animation-sig.json` (for the Theory page)
    * `animation-match.json` (for the Theory page)
    * `animation-scan.json` (for the Simulation page)

3.  **Use VS Code & Live Server:**
    * Open the project folder in **Visual Studio Code**.
    * Go to the Extensions tab and install the **"Live Server"** extension (by Ritwick Dey).
    * Right-click on `index.html` in the file explorer.
    * Click **"Open with Live Server"**.

4.  **Enjoy!** 🥳
    * Your browser will automatically open, and the fully animated website will be running.
